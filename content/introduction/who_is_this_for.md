As part of learning Go, you will need to install the Go programming language, which can be downloaded from https://golang.org/dl/. 

You will also need an editor or IDE to write and edit your code, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or GoLand. Finally, you will need to set up your Go workspace and the Go command-line tools. Once these are in place, you are ready to start coding in Go!
